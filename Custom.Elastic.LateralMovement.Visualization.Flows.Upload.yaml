name: Custom.Elastic.LateralMovement.Visualization.Flows.Upload

author: Kostya Ilioukevitch and Phalgun Kulkarni

description: |

  The artifact monitors the **`Custom.Windows.LateralMovement`** plugin, formats, and uploads the results to ElasticSearch for ***visualization***.

  The uploaded results can be imported into ***Grafana*** for visualization. Results are formatted to accommodate Grafana’s Node-Edge graph data requirements.

    - https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/node-graph/

  The index name is appended with `_visualization` for differentiating the index from the unformatted Custom.Windows.LateralMovement results.
